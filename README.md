#### Credit Scoring Business Understanding
Building a credit scoring model in a regulated financial environment requires a careful balance between statistical performance, business utility, and regulatory compliance. Below there is an  outline that describes the key business considerations driving our approach.

1. # The Basel II Accord and the Need for Interpretability
The Basel II Accord mandates that financial institutions maintain adequate capital reserves based on their risk exposure. This framework emphasizes the importance of transparent and well-documented credit risk models for:

Internal Risk Management: Institutions must explain how credit decisions are made and how risk is quantified.

Regulatory Review: Supervisory authorities require clear documentation of the model‚Äôs logic and assumptions.

#  Implication: We prioritize interpretable models (e.g., Logistic Regression with Weight of Evidence encoding) to ensure our model is not a ‚Äúblack box‚Äù and aligns with Basel II‚Äôs requirements for auditability, explainability, and governance.

### Creating a Proxy for Default: Why and What Risks It Carries
In our dataset, a direct "default" label is not available. To enable supervised learning, we create a proxy variable that defines default behavior ‚Äî such as "payment more than 90 days overdue."

### Why It‚Äôs Necessary: Without a target variable, supervised models cannot be trained. A proxy allows us to model creditworthiness using historical repayment behavior or similar signals.

‚ö†Ô∏è Risks of Using a Proxy:

Label Misalignment: If the proxy does not accurately reflect actual default risk, predictions may be misleading.

Biased Decisions: Models may incorrectly label borrowers as risky or safe, leading to financial loss or discrimination.

Regulatory Exposure: Models based on poor proxies may fail compliance checks.

 Mitigation: this document implies proxy assumptions, validate them through domain knowledge, and monitor model performance post-deployment.

### Model Trade-offs: Interpretability vs. Predictive Power
Aspect	Simple Models (e.g., Logistic Regression + WoE)	Complex Models (e.g., Gradient Boosting)
Interpretability	High ‚Äì easy to explain to stakeholders	Low ‚Äì often a black box
Performance	Moderate	High ‚Äì captures nonlinear relationships
Compliance Readiness	Strong ‚Äì aligns with Basel II and model audit	Weaker ‚Äì requires additional explainability tools
Operational Simplicity	Easy to implement and maintain	More resource-intensive

## Conclusion: In regulated settings, we often start with interpretable models to establish trust and pass compliance. Complex models can later be tested in parallel, provided they are accompanied by explainability frameworks (e.g., SHAP, LIME) and rigorous monitoring.

üìå Final Note: The credit scoring strategy is not just about optimizing metrics ‚Äî it's about building responsible, transparent, and compliant systems that support both business goals and customer trust.

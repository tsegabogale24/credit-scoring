## 📘 Credit Scoring Business Understanding

Building a credit scoring model in a regulated financial environment requires a thoughtful balance between **statistical accuracy**, **business value**, and **regulatory compliance**. This section outlines the key business considerations behind our modeling decisions.

### 1. 🧾 The Basel II Accord and the Need for Interpretability

The **Basel II Accord** requires financial institutions to maintain adequate capital reserves based on their credit risk exposure. It emphasizes:

- **Internal Risk Management**: Institutions must clearly explain how credit decisions are made.
- **Regulatory Review**: Supervisory authorities require transparent documentation of model assumptions and logic.

💡 **Implication**:  
To meet these standards, we prioritize **interpretable models** — such as **Logistic Regression with Weight of Evidence (WoE)** — to ensure our credit scoring system is explainable, auditable, and aligned with regulatory expectations.

### 2. 🏷️ Creating a Proxy for Default: Necessity and Risks

Our dataset lacks a direct "default" label. To enable supervised learning, we define a **proxy variable** for default — for example, **"payment overdue by 90+ days."**

#### ✅ Why It's Necessary:
- Supervised models need a target variable.
- Proxy enables learning from repayment history and behavioral signals.

#### ⚠️ Risks of Using a Proxy:
- **Label Misalignment**: Poorly defined proxies can misrepresent actual default risk.
- **Biased Decisions**: Inaccurate proxies may lead to unfair or incorrect lending decisions.
- **Regulatory Exposure**: Misleading models based on flawed proxies may fail audits.

🛠️ **Mitigation**:
We carefully document proxy assumptions, validate them with domain experts, and monitor model performance post-deployment to detect drift or bias.

### 3. ⚖️ Model Trade-offs: Interpretability vs. Predictive Power

| **Aspect**              | **Simple Models (e.g., Logistic Regression + WoE)** | **Complex Models (e.g., Gradient Boosting)** |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Interpretability**    | ✅ High – easy to explain                           | ❌ Low – often a black box                    |
| **Performance**         | ⚠️ Moderate                                         | ✅ High – captures nonlinear patterns         |
| **Compliance Readiness**| ✅ Strong – audit-friendly                          | ❌ Weaker – requires explainability tools     |
| **Operational Simplicity**| ✅ Easy to deploy & maintain                     | ❌ More resource-intensive                    |

💡 **Conclusion**:  
In regulated environments, we typically begin with **interpretable models** to build trust and ensure compliance. More complex models (e.g., Gradient Boosting) can be introduced later, supported by **explainability tools** such as **SHAP** or **LIME**.

### 📌 Final Note

Credit scoring isn’t just about high accuracy — it's about building **responsible, transparent, and compliant systems** that serve business goals while protecting consumers and aligning with regulatory frameworks.
